The Moxin Organization is an open community for discovery and exploration of AI LLMs. It is a welcoming, public space to gather and discover projects and resources related to LLMs, Agents, and other AI related topics.

## Projects

* [Moxin LLM](https://github.com/moxin-org/Moxin-LLM) - a family of high-performance, truly open, and fully reproducible LLMs that excels in zero-shot tasks and efficient operation on edge devices.
* [Moxin VLM](https://github.com/moxin-org/Moxin-VLM) - built upon the Moxin-LLM backbone, a VLM designed for advanced vision-language understanding and interaction.
* [Moly](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly) - a cross-platform AI model chat application which works with local & cloud models, built in Rust using [Makepad](https://github.com/makepad) Framework and [Project Robius](https://github.com/project-robius) platform tools.
* [MoFA](https://github.com/moxin-org/mofa) - a software framework for building AI agents through a composition-based approach. Using MoFA, AI agents can be constructed via templates and combined in layers to form more powerful Super Agents.
