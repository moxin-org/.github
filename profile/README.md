The Moxin organization is an open community for discovery and exploration of AI LLMs. It is a welcoming, public space to gather and discover projects and resources related to LLMs, Agents, and other AI related topics.

These are projects we're working on:

* [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/Moxin-LLM) is a family of fully open-source and reproducible LLMs
* [Moly](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly) is a cross-platform AI model chat application which works with local as well as cloud models, built in Rust using the [Makepad](https://github.com/makepad) Framework and [Project Robius](https://github.com/project-robius) platform tools.
* [MoFA](https://github.com/moxin-org/mofa) is a software framework for building AI agents through a composition-based approach. Using MoFA, AI agents can be constructed via templates and combined in layers to form more powerful Super Agents.

[https://github.com/moxin-org/moly](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly)

* Currently under active development, and looking for help!
* Allow exploration of latest large language models
* Allow searching of LLMs based on different criteria
* Allow filtering of search results
* Allow downloading of those models
* Allow running of models on user's local device (currently macOS)
* Allow Chat interactions with downloaded models
* Allow easy swtiching of different running local models
* More...
